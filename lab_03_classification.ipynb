    "### One-Hot Encoding and Image Flattened Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Our labels contain a list of predictions for our examples, e.g. [1, 9, ...]. In tensorflow, the label has to be converted to the encoding format as so-called One-Hot encoding. This means the labels have been converted from a single number to a vector whose length equals the number of possible classes. All elements of the vector are zero except for the $i$'th element which is one and means the class is $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, because we are going to use linear layers and multiplications of the neural network, you always want your data to be a (1 or) 2-dimensional matrix, where each row is the vector representing your data. Therefore, it would be more complicated and less efficient without reshaping images first. Here, we need to flatten images before passing them to our model. As an example, please print out the One-Hot encoded labels for the first 5 images in the test set."

TensorFlow can automatically calculate the gradients that are needed to optimize the variables of the graph to make the model perform better. This is because the graph is a combination of simple mathematical expressions so the gradient of the entire graph can be calculated using the chain rule for derivatives.\n",

This is a so-called tensor, which just means that it is a multi-dimensional vector or matrix. The data-type is set to `float32` and the shape is set to `[None, image_size_flat]`, where `None` means that the tensor may hold an arbitrary number of images with each image being reshaped into a vector of length `image_size_flat` which is equal to image_size * image_size. In addition, we create a constant tensor for the validation and test set since they are fixed and will be evaluated later.   \n",

The shape of this placeholder variable is `[None, num_labels]` which means it may hold an arbitrary number of labels and each label is a vector of length `num_labels` which is 10 in this case."

The first variable that must be optimized are `WEIGHTS` and defined here as a TensorFlow variable that must be initialized and whose shape is `[image_size_flat, num_labels]` for the simple linear model, so it is a 2-dimensional tensor (or matrix) with `image_size_flat` rows and `num_labels` columns. There are various ways to initialize the weights like initialization with zeros `tf.zeros`, `tf.truncated_normal` and `tf.random_normal`, which output random values from a normal distribution and you can specify the mean and The standard deviation (`stddev`) of the normal distribution.\n",

    "\n",

    "The cross-entropy is a performance measure used in classification. The cross-entropy is a continuous function that is always positive and if the predicted output of the model exactly matches the desired output then the cross-entropy equals zero. The goal of optimization is, therefore, to minimise the cross-entropy, so it gets as close to zero as possible by changing the `WEIGHTS` and `BIASES` of the model.\n",

    "TensorFlow has a built-in function for calculating the cross-entropy using `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`. Note that it uses the values of the `LOGITS` in train, validation and test sets because it also calculates the softmax internally. In order to use the cross-entropy to guide the optimization of the model's variables we need a single scalar value, so we simply take the average of the cross-entropy using (`tf.reduce_mean`) for all the image classifications."
